Facebook is essential to be able to reach customers. According to the statistics, the store has a good reach among people who prefer to use Facebook. Facebook has excellent coverage worldwide among people who can purchase products online.

"ArtisticEdge" Facebook page is for marketing purposes to post adverts and exciting content and engage users.

![ArtisticEdge Facebook Page](documentation/web_marketing/facebook_mockup.png)

---


**3. LinkedIn - [Link to Page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/artisticedgedesign/)**

"ArtisticEdge" LinkedIn page is useful to reach businesses in need of Web and Graphic Design Services. It is used for marketing purposes, pro-active outreach and afvert post, exciting content and to start discussions in the Design industry.

![ArtisticEdge LinkedIn Page](documentation/web_marketing/linkedin_mockup.png)

**Note:** *`rel="noopener noreferrer"` was used for all social links opening in a new tab*.

### SEO implementations in HTML

- META descriptions for search engines:

  - *Explore ArtisticEdge, your global partner for exceptional graphic design services. Specializing in web design, branding, and visual graphics, we elevate your brand with custom, high-quality design solutions tailored to your unique needs.* 

  The description was written to be engaging and informative, summarizing the core services ("web design, branding, visual graphics") and unique value proposition ("custom, high-quality design solutions tailored to your unique needs"). This clarity enhances click-through rates from search engine results pages by appealing directly to potential clients looking for custom design services.

- Keywords:

  - *ArtisticEdge, graphic design Ireland, web design services, custom branding services, graphic design studio, visual graphics, logo design, user interface design, digital art, promotional graphics, Ireland design services, global design services*

  The keywords include specific services and geographical tags such as "graphic design Ireland" and "global design services" to target both local and international markets. Keywords like "web design services", "custom branding services", and "logo design" are directly related to the business's offerings, increasing the relevance of the page for those particular search queries.

- Title: 

  - *ArtisticEdge | Expert Graphic Design Services | Ireland and Worldwide*

  The title was chosen to effectively communicate the brand name and main service offering while emphasizing geographical scope. This helps in attracting both local and global audiences.

### Other SEO implementations

1. Implemented a sitemap.xml into the root directory for the project. 

  - Used https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/ to create the sitemap.xml
  - The sitemap can then be registered in the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome).

2. Implemented a robots.txt into the root directory for the project.

  - The robots.txt file can be tested directly on Google [here](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598).

**Note:** *As this is not a requirement for this project, the sitemap was not registered and robots.txt was not tested.*

## Future Development

#### Support Chat

Chat support is planned to be implemented to provide the customers with the best possible service.

#### Payment system

I want to implement PayPal payment system in the future as many customers prefer it. I am also considering adding more payment functionality into the Stripe payment system already implemented, so the user can choose their preferred method.

#### Order cancellation

At the moment, the customer would need to manually reach out to cancel an order. As this would require a payment refund, this feature requires more research time to implement, which is why it is not implemented at this stage.

#### Improved Email Design

The notification emails sent out at the moment are plain text and in some cases not formatted. This is due to time constraints during this project and as a developer I made the decision to improve on the emails at a later stage as it is not a crucial feature for the website functionality.

#### Personalized Recommendations

The personalized recommendations should be based on items on the wishlist and previous purchases. This needs some more research time to implement.

#### Guest Checkout

This was not implemented yet due to time constraints, but is planned for future development.

#### Invoice Creation

At the moment, the store owner is able to see the billing details in the account, so would be able to manually create invoice. An automatic invoice creation option would require more research time.

#### Analytics Dashboard

It would be great to see a detailed analytics dashboard that provides insights in sales performance. This should help in understanding which services are popular and see when customers abandoned a cart.

#### Abandoned Cart Notifications

In addition to the dashboard a simple abandoned cart notification is planned for future development, allowing the store owner to follow up with the customer or potential customer.

## Features


Please refer to the [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) file for all test-related documentation.


---
## Design

The design of the website embraces the robust and intentional aesthetic of [Material Design principles](https://www.creative-tim.com/blog/web-design/12-absolute-principles-material-design/). In aligning with these guidelines, a minimalistic color palette has been selected that enhances usability while adhering to Material Design standards. The design approach is minimalistic, prioritizing clarity and utility, ensuring that every element serves a purpose without distracting from the user's core objectives.

This multifunctional application is designed to enrich the customer experience and streamline business management processes. It incorporates numerous components, each crafted to operate cohesively within a larger system. The strategic use of white space throughout the application's interface plays a pivotal role in this design, fostering a calming and pleasant user environment. This thoughtful spacing allows users, whether they are customers or staff members, to focus more effectively on the essential content and tasks at hand.

By emphasizing simplicity and functionality, the application not only meets the demands of modern business operations but also delivers a delightful and intuitive user experience.

### Color Scheme

The application's color scheme is based on the combination of bold and neutral colors. The bold colors are used to create a more vibrant and attractive user experience and get the attention of the user. The neutral colors are used to create a more calm and relaxed user experience that goes along with the highlight color.

  ![Color Scheme](documentation/design/colors_main.png)

- Pink (`#E83D95`) - This is the primary color used extensively throughout the site for focus states, buttons, links, and other interactive elements. It is the brand color and is used to draw attention to important features and controls.
- Lighter Pink (`#E56D90`) - This color appears in hover states for links and buttons, providing a subtle visual cue of interactivity. It is used to maintain a cohesive aesthetic while differentiating user interactions.
- Black (`#000000`) - Used as a background color in various places such as the top banner and footer, providing a strong contrast against the pink tones.
- White (`#FFFFFF`) - Commonly used for text and background in dropdown menus and other elements, providing contrast against the darker tones of the top banner and footer, and enhancing readability.
- Gold (`#FFD700`) - This color is used for star ratings, adding a classic color often associated with quality and value, which helps to visually signify rating levels in a traditional, easily understandable way.

The color scheme for the text is quite simple to create a more readable user experience. It is using the bootsrap attributes to either use dark or light text.

Accent colors are implemented with the pink primary color `#E83D95` to help users navigate the application. The accent colors are used to create a more vibrant and attractive user experience.

  ![Accent Scheme](documentation/design/color_accent.png)

### Typography

ArtisticEdge employs system fonts for its typography, providing a familiar and efficient user experience. This approach ensures optimal readability and quick loading times, as it uses the default fonts already installed on users' devices. The use of system fonts not only enhances performance but also maintains a consistent look across various platforms, aligning seamlessly with the intuitive and user-friendly design of the website.

### Imagery

- The website uses the same style of illustration images throughout for a cohesive user experience. The images use the primary color as the focus color.

- Images were downloaded from [Storyset](https://storyset.com/online).

- The main part is allocated to using icons from the [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website. Icons are essential for the user experience when it comes to multifunctional websites.

## Agile Methodology

### GitHub Project Management

GitHub Project Management was used to manage the project. If it hadn't been for the GitHub project management, I wouldn't have been able to manage the development of the application. It helped me to prioritize the tasks and to keep track of my progress.

## Flowcharts

To understand some concepts, I created several flowchart diagrams.

1. Sending stock email notifications to users who have left a request for a particular product inventory.
